# Webcam Snapshot View

An ampersand view which renderes a video tag with a webrtc video stream, and allows you to take a snapshot. Currently aimed at avatars although should be easily configurable when I tidy it up.

## Installation

```
npm install ampersnand-webcam-snapshot-view --save
```

## Usage

Check the [demo](http://ampersandjs.github.io/ampersand-webcam-snapshot-view/demo/) for now and look at [the code](./demo).
